This includes each school\u2019s name, type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, and the percentages of students passing math, reading, and both.<br>\n", "The schools are then ranked based on their overall passing percentage. The top 5 schools, saved in a DataFrame called \u201ctop_schools\u201d, are those with the highest overall passing percentages. Conversely, the bottom 5 schools, saved in a DataFrame called \u201cbottom_schools\u201d, have the lowest overall passing percentages.<br>\n", "The analysis also includes a breakdown of average math and reading scores for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.<br>\n", "School performance is further analyzed based on average spending ranges per student. Schools are categorized into spending bins, and the average math score, average reading score, and passing percentages are calculated for each spending range.<br>\n", "The analysis also considers school size, categorizing schools as small, medium, or large based on the total number of students. A DataFrame called \u201csize_summary\u201d breaks down school performance based on these size categories.<br>\n", "Finally, the analysis looks at school performance based on school type. A new DataFrame, \u201ctype_summary\u201d, shows key metrics for each type of school. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that may influence school and student performance.<br>\n", "Based on the provided data, we can draw several conclusions:<br>\n", "School Type and Performance: Charter schools tend to have a higher overall passing percentage compared to District schools. For instance, the top five schools in terms of overall passing percentage are all Charter schools, with Cabrera High School leading at approximately 91.33%. On the other hand, the bottom five schools, which are all District schools, have an overall passing percentage just above 50%.<br>\n", "School Size and Performance: There seems to be a correlation between school size and student performance. Smaller schools (with fewer students) tend to have higher average math and reading scores. For example, Pena High School, which is smaller in size, has high average scores in both math (83.62 in 9th grade) and reading (83.67 in 9th grade).<br>\n", "Grade Level and Performance: The average math and reading scores do not vary significantly across different grade levels within the same school. This suggests that the school\u2019s teaching quality is consistent across all grades.<br>\n", "Spending and Performance: Higher spending per student does not necessarily lead to better performance. In fact, schools that spend less per student often have higher overall passing percentages. This suggests that factors other than funding may play a more significant role in student performance.<br>\n", ""]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Dependencies and Setup"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pandas as pd\n", "from pathlib import Path"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["File to Load (Remember to Change These)"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["school_data_to_load = Path(\"/Users/davidskaff/Desktop/schools_complete.csv\")\n", "student_data_to_load = Path(\"/Users/davidskaff/Desktop/students_complete.csv\")"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Read School and Student Data File and store into Pandas DataFrames"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["school_data = pd.read_csv(school_data_to_load)\n", "student_data = pd.read_csv(student_data_to_load)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Combine the data into a single dataset.
